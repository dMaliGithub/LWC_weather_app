# Weather App

This is an guided LWC project created to demonstarte various LWC concepts. This is a web based application integrated with 3rd party open weather API (link) using REST API Call. Demonstrates how client side and server side api call happens and how a server side API call is more secure that client side API call.

Here the Server side call is made by creating a APEX class which communicates to 3rd Party API using REST API. Guest users can be given access to APEX class through guest user profile.

Client side call can be made using FetchApi.

Apart from API call this project covers various other LWC concepts like:
- Data Binding
- Using static resources in JS
- Dynamic styling
- Conditional Rendering
- Using SLDS built in classes for styling
- Styling using custom CSS
- 3rd party API call
- Remote site settings
- How to provide access to Apex class to guest user
- Exposing LWC componenet to Experience site.
